Bill Gates is walking down Pennsylvania Avenue when he notices a $100 note slipping out of his wallet and landing on the floor right in front of him. Any normal person would:
1. Not have a $100 note in their wallet
2. Swiftly stoop down to pick up the note before it flies away
But Billy is no ordinary person. Every second he works makes him a staggering $1,000 richer. At such an elderly age, squatting to pick up the note would take him much longer than re-earning it by working.



This fictional setup is well-known among people who are savvy with finances and is frequently mentioned to back up one idea: that our time working should be as profitable as possible. To this mean, we need to delegate or dismiss unproductive tasks and make room for the cash cows. According to this, Bill Gates walks away and lets someone else have a lucky day with it https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-is-bill-gates-net-worth-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5#2-based-on-how-much-wealthier-gates-got-in-the-past-year-he-makes-approximately-1300-per-second-according-to-business-insider-calculations-3:~:text=That%20means%20it%20would%20not%20be%20worth%20his%20time%20to%20stop%20and%20pick%20up%20a%20%24100%20bill%20that%20he%20dropped%20on%20the%20ground..

Instead, he ducks as a peasant, takes the $100 and walks away. But why did Bill pick up the bill?
There are many possible reasons, so I will talk about the ones that have come to my mind.

## 1. His thoughts about money developed in a time were $100 was a significant amount for him, and they're still there
Bill Gates was born in a wealthy family, but they weren't nearly as rich as he is now, and his parents didn't spoil them so much that lowering his back would be worth more than $100. We form most of our guiding principles at a young age and, except for a shift towards conservatism, we pretty much keep the same ones after our 30s.  
Because of this, and even after decades of trumping Forbes rankings, he would still pick up the bill.

This is actually Bill Gates' justification on his answer when the question was posted in Reddit ://twitter.com/billgates/status/432932564786221056?lang=en.

I don't agree.

## 2. Picking up $100 if they fall on the floor is a social convention of the culture Bill Gates lives in
Imagine that


<!--IDEAS
What if he should order a computer to pick up the $100 instead of doing it himself?
