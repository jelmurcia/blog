You wake up one Monday. A Monday as any other. You go through your morning routine, study/work, go to dance class or Japanese lessons, spend some time with your family or friends, binge watch Netflix and go to sleep. Hopefully you haven't forgotten to eat along the way, too.
All activities you did this hypothetical day have something in common: You spent a commodity to do them and you got another one in return. Not easy to see?

1. You spent 8h at the office and you got 8\*YOUR_HOURLY_WAGE in return
2. You spent 15€ and 2h in dance class and got happiness and longevity in return (cause exercise makes you live longer)
3. You spent 4h watching and missed a date with a soul who could've turned your life around to watch The Squid Game, and gained baggy eyes from all the sleep you skipped and the ability to hop on the trend train for two weeks.
   There you are. Your whole day consists on trading some things for others of a different nature.

With this bartering being so fundamental to your existence, we must be such experts at taking the good deals, right? Let's just look at what you did today:

3. You spent 4h watching and forwent a date with a soul who could've turned your life around to watch The Squid Game, and gained baggy eyes from all the sleep you skipped and the ability to hop on the trend train for two weeks.

**forwent a date with a soul who could've turned your life around to watch The Squid Game, and gained baggy eyes**

**COULD'VE TURNED YOUR LIFE AROUND**

**BAGGY EYES**
Whoops.
What happened here is a reflection of how bad we actually are at deciding what is going to give us the most bang for the buck. And this happens for a number of reasons:

## 1. Humans were pretty good dealers in the Prehistory, but not in the 21st century

Explain that the pace at which we have changed the environment is too quick for evolution to catch up with the behavioural rules

## 2. Our biological goal is to ~~survive~~ have a lot of children, not to be happy

Explain why

## 3. We don't have a commodity of immovable value to pay for these trades

It could be money, time, energy...

- Money isn't because new bills and coins are printed, which decrease the value of every other bill and coin already in existence
- Time isn't you can't do the same with 1h at 10 a.m. than at 10 p.m.
- Energy isn't because how are you even going to measure it

## 4. We also don't have a commodity of immovable value to receive from these trades

It could be happiness, productivity, longevity...

- Happiness isn't because we still can't measure it
  - EEG's not available to peasants
  - Subjective self-measurements of happiness are not reliable
    Remember that ordinary party last year? Probably not, because it was ordinary. But if you're like most people, when your friend asked the day after how it was, you probably embellished it a bit. You do the same with yourself.
    - Your brain keeps your memories more like the freezer keeps a steak than like a collector keeps its trading cards
      Your memories lose flavour and you can't really assess the emotion they had in the moment

<!--IDEAS:
- Measurement through relative-to-threshold: use a threshold to divide between what's worth it and what's not: e.g. if I get less than 15€/h value doing this, then I delegate it
